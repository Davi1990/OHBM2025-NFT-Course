## Neural Field Theory & Brain Network Modelling @ OHBM 2025

This OHBM 2025 Educational Course offers a hands-on introduction to **Neural Field Theory (NFT)** and its application to connectome-based brain modelling.

The course focuses on the simulation of brain dynamics across large-scale networks using biophysically grounded field models, with comparisons to traditional neural mass approaches.
