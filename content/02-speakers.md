## **Richa Phogat, PhD**
*University of Newcastle*  
**Talk:** *Cortico-Hippocampal Interactions: Eigenmodes and Neural Field Modeling*

{{< figure class="image speaker" src="images/richa_phogat.jpg" alt="Richa Phogat" >}}

Dr. Phogat is a Computational Neuroscience Fellow at the University of Newcastle, NSW. Her current research focuses on developing a physically principled framework of cortico-hippocampal interactions. This framework helps understand how dynamic coupling and mode mixing drive healthy brain rhythms and how their disruption leads to more pathological brain activity. Her work combines theoretical neural field modeling with practical implementations to advance our understanding of complex brain dynamics.

## **John Griffiths, PhD**
*University of Toronto & Centre for Addiction and Mental Health*  
**Talk:** *Historical Overview and Conceptual Foundations of Neural Field Theory*

{{< figure class="image speaker" src="images/john_griffiths.jpg" alt="John Griffiths" >}}

Dr. Griffiths is an esteemed cognitive and computational neuroscientist and director of GriffLab. He has held various prestigious research positions, including a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Sydney School of Physics, where he collaborated with Professor Peter Robinson. He subsequently moved to Toronto, Canada, conducting research at the Rotman Research Institute with Dr. Randy McIntosh and the Krembil Research Institute with Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre. In January 2019, Dr. Griffiths joined the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH and the University of Toronto as a Scientist and Assistant Professor. With strong technical expertise in multimodal neuroimaging data analysis, scientific computing, and numerical simulations of large-scale brain dynamics, Dr. Griffiths is an active contributor to the scientific, software development, and educational endeavors of the Virtual Brain Project.

## **Peter Robinson, PhD**
*University of Sydney*  
**Talk:** *Mathematical Foundations and Corticothalamic Neural Field Theory*

{{< figure class="image speaker" src="images/peter_robinson.jpg" alt="Peter Robinson" >}}

Dr. Robinson is a foundational contributor to neural field theory, particularly in corticothalamic system modeling and brain activity eigenmodes. His work encompasses the mathematical derivation of neural field equations from physiological principles, development of the NFTsim simulation package, and groundbreaking research on brain rhythms including alpha, mu, and tau oscillations. His contributions include demonstrating how just four corticothalamic eigenmodes can explain key features of cortical rhythms, and establishing connections between brain geometry, connectivity, and dynamics. Professor Robinson is based at the University of Sydney's School of Physics and Center for Integrative Brain Function, where his extensive research spans over two decades focusing on continuum approaches to brain modeling, corticothalamic dynamics, and the mathematical foundations underlying brain oscillations and connectivity.

## **Viktor Jirsa, PhD**
*Institut de Neurosciences des Systèmes, Marseille*  
**Talk:** *From Theory to Applications: Virtual Brain Twins in Clinical Neuroscience*

{{< figure class="image speaker" src="images/viktor_jirsa.jpg" alt="Viktor Jirsa" >}}

Dr. Jirsa brings a unique perspective combining theoretical physics and computational neuroscience to understand how network structure constrains functional dynamics. Originally trained in Theoretical Physics and Philosophy in the 1990s, he has made fundamental contributions to understanding how network structure constrains the emergence of functional dynamics using methods from nonlinear dynamic system theory and computational neuroscience. His pioneering work has earned international recognition, including the François Erbsmann Prize (2001), NASPSPA Early Career Distinguished Scholar Award (2004), and Grand Prix de Recherche de Provence (2018). As one of the Lead Scientists in the Human Brain Project and The Virtual Brain initiative, he serves on multiple editorial boards and has published over 150 scientific articles and book chapters, including co-editing several influential works such as the Handbook of Brain Connectivity.
