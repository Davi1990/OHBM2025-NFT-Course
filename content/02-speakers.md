## **John Griffiths, PhD**
*University of Toronto & Centre for Addiction and Mental Health*  
**Talk:** *Historical Overview and Conceptual Foundations of Neural Field Theory*

{{< figure class="image speaker" src="images/john_griffiths.jpg" alt="John Griffiths" >}}

Dr. Griffiths will provide a largely non-technical survey of the key conceptual pillars of neural field theory (NFT), following the chronology of ideas from the 1940s through to 2025 and beyond. His introductory lecture traces NFT's development from its origins with McCulloch & Pitts through its "Annus Mirabilis" in the early 1970s with contributions from Amari, Wilson-Cowan, and Nunez. The aim is to lay foundations and set the scene for subsequent talks in the workshop.

**Bio:** John Griffiths is a leading researcher in computational neuroscience and whole-brain modeling at the University of Toronto and Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

## **Michael Breakspear, PhD**
*University of Newcastle*  
**Talk:** *Neural Field Theory: Mathematical Foundations and Cortical Rhythms*

{{< figure class="image speaker" src="static/images/michael_breakspear.jpg" alt="Michael Breakspear" >}}

Dr. Breakspear will trace the formal derivation of "classic NFT" from the physiological and anatomical properties of the brain, including synaptic filtering, somatic summation, nonlinear gain, and signal propagation. His talk demonstrates how NFT can be written as a damped wave equation, whose behavior predicts transitions in sleep-wake cycles, spatial and temporal spectra of cortical activity, and the impact of neuromodulation. A particular focus will be on how just 4 corticothalamic activity eigenmodes can explain key features of alpha, mu, and tau rhythms.

**Bio:** Michael Breakspear is a prominent researcher in neural field theory and brain dynamics at the University of Newcastle, with foundational contributions to understanding cortical rhythms and corticothalamic interactions.

## **Richa Phogat, PhD**
*University of Newcastle*  
**Talk:** *Cortico-Hippocampal Interactions: Eigenmodes and Neural Field Modeling*

{{< figure class="image speaker" src="images/richa_phogat.jpg" alt="Richa Phogat" >}}

Dr. Phogat will provide a practical introduction to neural field modeling focusing on cortico-hippocampal interactions through eigenmodesâ€”a mathematical framework capturing intrinsic oscillatory patterns. Her session includes step-by-step implementation of: (1) preparing anatomical surfaces, (2) computing eigenmodes for spatial activity patterns by solving the Helmholtz equation, and (3) integrating eigenmodes into the NFT framework. Hands-on exercises will cover eigenmode computation, visualization, and simulation of spatio-temporal dynamics including mode-mixing and pathological states.

**Bio:** Richa Phogat is a researcher specializing in neural field modeling and cortico-hippocampal dynamics at the University of Newcastle.

## **Sora An**
*Ewha Womans University, Seoul*  
**Talk:** *Virtual Brain Modeling for Deep Brain Stimulation Applications*

{{< figure class="image speaker" src="images/sora_an.jpg" alt="Sora An" >}}

Dr. An will present a virtual brain modeling approach for personalized exploration of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), particularly in treatment-resistant depression. Her talk covers the construction of patient-specific virtual brain models from structural data, high-resolution connectome-based neural field modeling, and explicit fiber tract modeling. The presentation includes numerical simulations examining regional activations and EEG-projected activity patterns evoked by DBS stimulation of specific fiber tracts, demonstrating how different tracts elicit distinct spatiotemporal activity patterns.

**Bio:** Sora An is a researcher at Ewha Womans University specializing in virtual brain modeling and clinical applications of neural field theory.

## **Davide Momi, PhD**
*Stanford University*  
**Talk:** *Hands-on Neural Field Theory: From Theory to Implementation*

{{< figure class="image speaker" src="images/davide_momi.jpg" alt="Davide Momi" >}}

Dr. Momi will lead two comprehensive hands-on sessions bridging theoretical concepts with practical applications using interactive Python notebooks in Google Colab. Building on the success of previous OHBM educational courses, these sessions provide participants with hands-on experience in implementing and exploring NFT concepts. The first session focuses on fundamental NFT implementations, while the second explores advanced applications including brain rhythms and cortico-hippocampal interactions. All materials will be freely available following OHBM's commitment to open science.

**Bio:** Davide Momi is a computational neuroscientist at Stanford University, specializing in brain stimulation, neural field theory, and hands-on education in computational neuroscience.

## **Course Structure & Integration**

The course combines **theoretical depth** with **practical application**:

- **Morning Session:** Historical foundations and mathematical derivations
- **Afternoon Session:** Applications and hands-on implementations  
- **Interactive Elements:** Google Colab notebooks with real neuroimaging data
- **Open Science:** All materials freely available through public repositories

This combination of foundational contributors to NFT and researchers applying these methods to contemporary brain mapping challenges makes the course particularly valuable for bridging mathematical theory and empirical neuroscience.
