## **Course Legacy**

Building on the success of previous OHBM educational courses:

- **OHBM 2023 (Montreal)**: [Whole-brain, Connectome-based Models of Brain Dynamics: From Principles to Applications](https://griffithslab.github.io/OHBM-whole-brain-modelling-course/)
- **OHBM 2024 (Seoul)**: [Connectome-based models of whole-brain dynamics: from theoretical principle to practical application](https://griffithslab.github.io/OHBM2024-educational-course/) 
- **OHBM 2025 (Brisbane)**: Neural Field Theory applications

Each course has been designed to advance the field while maintaining our commitment to open science and educational excellence.
